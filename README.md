Checkmate Patterns in Chess

This repository contains an R script that visualizes checkmate patterns in chess using data from Kaggle and Lichess. The analysis involves:

    Filtering games to include only those that ended in checkmate.
    Extracting the last move and identifying the piece that delivered the checkmate.
    Creating heatmaps to visualize the frequency of checkmate moves across the chessboard.
    Generating bar plots showing the count of checkmates by piece type.

Libraries Used

    dplyr
    stringr
    ggplot2
    ggpattern
    patchwork

Output

The final visualization combines multiple heatmaps and a bar chart, providing insights into how and where checkmates occur in chess games.

Feel free to explore the code and visuals. Contributions and feedback are welcome!
